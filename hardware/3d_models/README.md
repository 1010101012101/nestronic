# 3D Component Models

## Introduction

The 3D models used by the components in these schematics come from a variety
of sources. Some were created for this project, using KiCad's library
scripts and/or FreeCAD directly. Many others were downloaded from component
manufacturer websites.

Some manufacturers have a habit of freely distributing 3D models for their
components with attached notes saying that they shall not be redistributed.
These notes also often mention that the models are proprietary, confidential,
for personal use only, or something else that would scare you off from
actually admitting that you used them. As such, these models have not been
included in the project repository. Instead, link for downloading them
is provided.

The actual conversion of component models to WRL files is accomplished
with the [KiCad StepUp plugin](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kicadstepup/).

## Model List

The models are listed by base filename. Typical distribution files have
the ".step" extension, while the exported files have the ".wrl" extension.

To include models marked as not redistributable, download them from the
original source and convert using the KiCad StepUp plugin for FreeCAD.
Make sure the original and converted files have the same base name as
listed below.

Due to the incremental nature of project development, this list may include
models for components that are no longer part of the actual board design.
